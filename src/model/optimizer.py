Optimization functions for the sepsis utility score.

prediction cutoff thresholds so as to best optimise our score on this utility function.

    Sepsis predictions must be binary labels. Dependent on where these are in a patients time-series, we achieve a
    different utility score for that prediction. Our current methodology involves regressing against the utility
    function such that our output predictions are number in $\mathbb{R}$ with the expectation that larger values
    correspond to a higher likelihood of sepsis. To convert onto binary predictions we must choose some cutoff value,
    `thresh` with which to predict 1 (sepsis) if `pred > thresh` else 0. Given a set of predictions, this function
    optimizes that `thresh` value such that we would achieve the maximum utility score. This `thresh` value can now be
    used as the final step in the full model.

    This function would take a huge amount of time to compute if we did not compute for every patient, the utility
    of a zero or of a one prediction at each time-point in their series. The downside of this is that we must always
    specify the indexes from the full dataset from which the predictions correspond to, as we load in this precomputed
    scores tensor and query at the indexes to get the score.

        predictions (torch.Tensor): The predictions (or a subset of the predictions) on the data. NOTE: if idxs is
